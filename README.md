# phase1

A minimalistic example of a RESTful CRUD-application.

Lets you read, insert, update and delete entries containing

- City name
- Start date
- and some more, see [Data](#data)


## Starting and stopping the system

The whole application can be started and stopped through the provided scripts.
**First make sure the script-files are executable (`chmod a+x ./start.sh` etc.).**

| script        | action                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start.sh`    | starts all services, builds images if necessary          |
| `stop.sh`     | stops the services                                       |
| `clean_up.sh` | stops the services, removes persisted data from database |

## Connecting

The API will be served on Port `8080` of the host.
A simple UI will be served under `:8080/docs`.

The **default credentials** are:

- User: `dogbert`
- Password: `catbert`

## Data

### Versions

The versions of FastAPI and MongoDB can are pinned in the `.env` file.

``` [.env]
PROJECT_PREFIX=phase1
MONGO_VERSION=6.0.4
```

## Things that have not been done

- API-Versioning (maybe URL-versioning like `myapi/v1/`, see [FastAPI routers](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/))
- SSL (maybe offload to API-Gateway like [Kong](https://konghq.com/))
